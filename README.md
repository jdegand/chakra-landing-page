### Built With

- React
- Chakra UI
- React Router  

### Thoughts

- Used outdated tutorial to test out Chakra UI. 
- Upgraded from React Router 5 to 6.
- Used the create-react-app chakra template.
- Putting the CSS inside the components etc does bloat the code and can get in the way of reasoning about the code. 
- Almost have to indent and put all props on separate lines.
